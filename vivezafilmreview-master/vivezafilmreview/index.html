		<h1>My Film Review of <cite>The Greatest Showman</cite></h1>

			My Rating: 4 out of 5 stars (a must see!)

		<p>Not many enjoy musicals as much as I do.</p>
		<p>I can thank Director Michael Gracey along with the lyricists that brought us <cite>La La Land</cite> for the brilliant new film that has brought me endless karaoke days and nights.</p>
		<p><cite>The Greatest Showman</cite>.</p>
		<p>Within the first two seconds, I. Was. Hooked.</p>
		<p>The <strong>creativity</strong>.</p><img alt="hughjackmanasP.T.Barnum" src="images/ringmaster%20jackman.jpg">
		<p>The <strong>music</strong>.</p><img alt="zendayaandzacefronperformingrewritethestars" src="images/zendaya%20and%20zack.jpg">

		<p>Each carefully selected thing- from costumes, to the sets, to the songs- made this movie one that everyone can enjoy. You will walk out of the theater with the sense that you too can achieve anything you put your mind to (especially, if that idea is to create a circus).</p>
		<p>Based off the true story of P.T. Barnum and the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, this musical brings its audience into the mindset and journey of the man who did not quit until his dreams were met.</p>
		<p>Hugh Jackman, who plays Barnum in the film, considers Barnum to be a great contributor in the making of show business. His portrayal of the family/business man shows just that.</p>
		<p>Jackman isn't the only star who brought this story to life. The star-studded cast includes Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams.</p>
		<p>The performances along with the beautifully executed songs encapture what it feels like to have found your family. You experience first hand the character's struggles and successes.</p>
		<p>If you're looking for a true spectacle, look no further. <cite>The Greatest Showman</cite> is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. And like me, I'm sure you'll be singing along to the soundtrack too.</p>
